        There is no emotion, there is peace.
        There is no ignorance, there is knowledge.
        There is no passion, there is serenity.
        There is no chaos, there is harmony.
        There is no death, there is the Force.

        Peace is a lie. There is only Passion.
        Through Passion I gain Strength.
        Through Strength I gain Power.
        Through Power I gain Victory.
        Through Victory my chains are Broken.
        The Force shall free me.
